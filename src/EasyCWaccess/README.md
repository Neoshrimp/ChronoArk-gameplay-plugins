Adds an event object to 2-2 campfire which allows to purchase key to the Crimson Wilderness.  
Forgetting the stupid stealthy vending machine on 1-2 is the thing of the past!  

Optionally, entry cost can be changed in *neo.ca.qol.ezCrimson.cfg* config file.  
By default, the cost is the same as in vanilla, 4 soulstones and 2 keys.
