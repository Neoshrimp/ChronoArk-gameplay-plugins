## Recruit Clones

Allows to recruit same character multiple times.  
No adjustments have been made for balance or correctness so some skills might not work as expected.  
The only exception is the Phoenix who now faints at -2\**maxHp*.

Overall, this mod is more of a quick joke rather than a polished project.  
Maybe it will get some improvements at somepoint(tm).
